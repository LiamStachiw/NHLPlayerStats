# NHLPlayerStats

This is meant to be an application used to find the best players in the NHL based on different aspects of the game. These stats are entirely made up and just for fun. Please don't take anything on the page seriously. The main intention of this app is to essentially act as a sandbox to mess around with python while using data that I find interesting. All stats are provided by MoneyPuck.com

## Defensive Skater Stats
Defensive score is calculated by using a combination of the player's on ice expected goals for %, shot attempts blocked %, on ice corsi %, % of penalties taken vs. drawn, % of takeaways vs. giveaways, and their defensive zone start %.
